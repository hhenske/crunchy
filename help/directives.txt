         &print This line should be displayed.
         &goto skip
         &print This line should not be displayed.
         skip:
         &print This line should be displayed.

   &output on|off

      Enable or disable the output, but otherwise process the data as usual.

   &print [<options>] [<text>]

      Display a line of content.

      Options:

         -f | --force

            Force the text to be displayed, even if output mode is turned off.

   &read [<options>] [path]<filename>

      Read and process the contents of the specified file.

      This directive works recursively, up to a certain number of levels.  Any environment settings changed during the &read process will revert when it terminates and returns control to the calling process.

      Options:

         -i | --inline

            Do not read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The current/updated environment values are retained when &read completes or is terminated.

         -s | --sandbox

            Default.  Read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The environment values revert to their original values when &read completes or is terminated.
