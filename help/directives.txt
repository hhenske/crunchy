Help Topic: Directives

   &cd [<path>]

      Change the current working directory to <path>, or reset it if no path is specified.

   &cli [<options>] [<files>] [-h [<topic>] | --help [<topic>] | ... ]

      Run options and parameters as if from the command line.  To a certain extent, this is useful for scripting.

      Note that the termination behavior of this directive depends on the options and parameters being specified.  Some combinations will start an interactive process, while others will instead start an inline process and then terminate the current interactive process.  With a &read process that encounters the &cli directive, control will thereafter be returned to the calling interactive session, unless that &read directive invokes inline mode.

   &goto <label>

      Jump to the next line with the specified label.

      Example:

         &print This line should be displayed.
         &goto skip
         &print This line should not be displayed.
         skip:
         &print This line should be displayed.

   &header [<options>] [<field name>[<alignment>]<width> ...]

      Define/redefine the headers and/or display the current headers.

      Options:

         -q | --quiet

         Do not display the header, regardless of output mode.

         &help data-format

   &help [<topic>]

      Display help information.

   &identify

      Display the name of the currently loaded plugin.

      See also:

         &help plugins

   &infomsg on|off

      Enable or disable the informational output.

   &map <descriptors>

      Remap the fields so that they display in a specified order.

      See also:

         &help map

   &output on|off

      Enable or disable the output, but otherwise process the data as usual.

   &print [<options>] ["][<text>]["]

      Display a line of content.  Optionally, the content can be enclosed in double quotes, but the matching double quote at the end is not strictly required.  In all cases, the content is treated as a string literal (which may contain double quotes).

      Options:

         -f | --force

            Force the text to be displayed, even if output mode is turned off.

   &read [<options>] [path]<filename>

      Read and process the contents of the specified file.

      This directive works recursively, up to a certain number of levels.  Any environment settings changed during the &read process will revert when it terminates and returns control to the calling process.

      Options:

         -i | --inline

            Do not read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The current/updated environment values are retained when &read completes or is terminated.

         -s | --sandbox

            Default.  Read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The environment values revert to their original values when &read completes or is terminated.

      See also:

         &help read

   &stop

      Stop processing data.  This either ends a sandbox process or terminates the entire interactive or inline process.

   &use [<plugin>]

      Start using the specified plugin (e.g., banking or example).  Various environment aspects will change, such as available directives and data processing flows.  By default, the shell plugin is active.

      If no plugin parameter is specified, the name of the loaded plugin will be displayed, followed by a list of available plugins.

         &help plugins

   &var <variable> <value-1> [<value-2> ...]

   &var <variable-1>[,<variable-2>,...] <value-1>[,<value-2>,...]

   <value-1>[,<value-1>,...]
   <value-2>[,<value-2>,...]
   ...
   <end-marker>

      Create or reassign variables and assign values to them.
