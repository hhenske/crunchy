   &print [<options>] ["][<text>]["]

      Display a line of content.  Optionally, the content can be enclosed with double quotes, but the matching double quote at the end is not required.  In all cases, the content is treated as a string literal (which may contain double quotes).

   &read [<options>] [path]<filename>

      Read and process the contents of the specified file.

      This directive works recursively, up to a certain number of levels.  Any environment settings changed during the &read process will revert when it terminates and returns control to the calling process.

      Options:

         -i | --inline

            Do not read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The current/updated environment values are retained when &read completes or is terminated.

         -s | --sandbox

            Default.  Read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The environment values revert to their original values when &read completes or is terminated.

      Applies to:  general usage
