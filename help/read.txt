Help Topic: &read

   Usage: &read [<options>] [path]<filename>

   This directive allows you to read an external file from within a data file, and the contents are essentially processed as if they were part of that originating data file.

   This directive works recursively up to a certain depth, so the files being read may also use the &read directive.  When a &read process is launched, the environment values are copied from the calling process.  Any environment settings changed during the external file read process will revert after completion or termination.

   Note that the &stop directive has certain effects on the &read process.  During a sandbox process, the &stop directive will return control to the calling process.  However, during an inline process, the entire session will be terminated.

   Options:

      -i | --inline

         Do not read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The current/updated environment values are retained when &read          completes or is terminated.

      -s | --sandbox

         Default.  Read the file in an isolated sandbox context.  The environment values revert to their original values when &read    completes or is terminated.
