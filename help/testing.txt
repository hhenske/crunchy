Help Topic: Testing

   If you are involved in the development of Crunchy Report Generator, you may want to use the testing directives to perform regression testing.  You may also find this functionality useful when you need to report bugs.

   Testing directives:

      &test start <filename>

         Start running a test and compare the output to the contents of <filename>.

      &test pause

         Temporarily pause comparing the output against the contents of the file previously specified by the &test start directive.

      &test resume

         Resume comparing the output to the contents of the file previously specified by the &test start directive.

      &test verbose

         Display all test messages.

      &test quiet

         Only show the most important test messages.  This is the default.

      &test stop

         Stop the test.

   Testing options:

      -st | --skip-testing

         Run the data as usual and ignore all testing directives and options.

      -tv | --test-verbose

         Run testing in verbose mode (same as &test verbose).

      -tfv | --test-force-verbose

         Force testing in verbose mode, even if quiet mode is specified.

      -tfq | --test-force-quiet

         Force testing in quiet mode, even if verbose mode is specified.
