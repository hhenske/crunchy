Help Topic: Data Format

   The first non-directive line specifies the header, and subsequent non-directive lines feed the data.  Directives add more information about how the data is to be crunched.  For readability, the delimiter is two spaces between fields, and a field cannot contain two consecutive spaces.

   Minimal example:

      &init 2013.12
      &set decfield 2
      &set clrfield 3
      &set incfield 4
      Check|5     Date|10   Payment8  Clear1   Deposit8  Description<22
            -  11/01/2023      10.45       *          -  Wordpress hosting
            -  11/01/2023      48.77       *          -  Torchy's
            -  11/01/2023          -       *    1500.00  paycheck
            -  11/01/2023     745.00       -          -  apartment

   Header:

      <field name>[<alignment>]<width> ...

      The header line specifies each field's name, width, and format.  The field descriptors must be separated by at least two spaces.

      Example of a header line:

         Check|5  Date|10  Payment8  Clear1  Deposit8  Description<22

      Examples of field descriptors:

         Check|5

            The field label is "Check," the width is 5, and field data is centered.

         Payment8

            By default, the field data is right-justified.  Payment>8 would be the same.

         Description<22

            With the < symbol, the field data is left-justified.

   Directives:

      Directives are commands starting with an ampersand (&).

      Examples:

         &print [<text>]

            Send some text to stdout.

         &read <filename>

            Read an external file.

         &help [<topic>]

            Display some help information.

   Labels:

      <label>:

      Labels can be specified to provide a target for the &goto directive.

      Example:

         &print This line should be displayed.
         &goto skip
         &print This line should not be displayed.
         skip:
         &print This line should be displayed.

   Comments:

      Comments can be written in the following ways:

         # this is a comment

         // this is a comment

         /* this is
         a multi-line
         comment
         */
